a) Create classes for different components e.g. record deck, CD player etc.
DONE

b) Each class will have instance variables particular to that component e.g. a record deck may have play speeds, a CD player may have a number of CDs it can play at a time (think of the old-fashioned multi-changers).
DONE

c) each component should have its own make and model
DONE

d) As the stereo is made up of separate components, and methods to operate them e.g. a CD player might have a play method.
DONE

If different components have the same methods then this might suggest that they implement the same interface
